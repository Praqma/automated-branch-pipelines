# Configuration of the branch pipeline service and the external systems.

## Configuration of the branch pipeline service.
service:
  # The port number for the service. This is the port that an SCM system sends requests to.
  port: 8181


## Configuration of projects.
#  Each project is identified by a repository name. The repository name is sent to the
#  branch pipeline service in an SCM request.
projects:
  # This example shows a Bitbucket repository called test-abs.
  test-abs:
    # URL for reaching the CI server.
    ciUrl: http://192.168.99.100:8080

    # Name of the Job DSL seed job. Only applicable for Jenkins.
    seedJob: seed

    # Jobs that constitute a pipeline. These are job prefixes, to which a branch name will
    # be appended.
    #
    # The definition of a pipeline is configured per branch prefix.
    # This also means that only the branch prefixes listed in this map are considered as
    # relevant by the service.
    #
    # To match a prefix, a branch must have the format {prefix}/{branch}, for example
    # "feature/1337-coolfeature".
    pipelines:
      # This example shows that for branches with the "feature/" prefix, such as
      # feature/1337-coolfeature, a build pipeline consists of the commit, test and
      # release jobs.
      # Notice that the slash in the branch prefix is not included in this map.
      feature:
        - commit
        - test

      maintenance:
        - commit
        - test
        - release
